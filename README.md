# Programming for Data Analysis - Project 2

## Introduction

The PdDA_Project2 repository contains a jupyter notebook with our last project of the module Programming for Data Analysis part of the Higher Diploma of Data Analytics course from the ATU University.

## Jupyter Notebook 

In order to open this project you will need to have Jupyter installed. You can find the installation documentation for the [Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install.html). The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You can install Jupyter using  [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/), which is the package manager for Python.

```
pip install jupyter
```

Once you have installed Jupyter, you can start the notebook server by running the following command in your terminal:

```
Jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter dashboard, which will show the files and directories in the current directory. You can then navigate to the directory where you have saved your notebook file, and click on the notebook file to open it. The notebook will be displayed in a new tab in your web browser.

In order to run this repository locally you will need to clone this repository.

To clone this repository using the command line, you will need to have Git installed on your system. You can check if Git is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```
git --version
```

If Git is not installed, you can install it by following the instructions for your operating system from the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Once you have Git installed, you can clone a repository using the git clone command followed by the URL of the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:git@github.com:LaisColetta/PdDA_Project2.git
```

This will create a new directory called repository, and download the contents of the repository into that directory. The directory name is created based on the name of the repository you are cloning.


## About this repository

In this repository there is a jupyter notebook called Project2, a gitignore (personalised for macos) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset csv file. 

The Project2 is our final assessment in which we had to discuss the following topics based on our dataset:

• Undertake an analysis/review of the dataset and present an overview and background.
• Provide a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the dataset and
compare their performance
• Present a statistical analysis of the dataset
• Using a range of machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset (using
SKLearn etc.) and present classification performance results. Detail your rationale for the
parameter selections you made while training the classifiers.
• Compare, contrast and critique your results with reference to the literature
• Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended – using data synthesis of new
tumour datapoints
• Document your work in a Jupyter notebook.
• As a suggestion, you could use Pandas, Seaborn, SKLearn, etc. to perform your analysis.
• Please use GitHub to demonstrate research, progress and consistency.

All the references I used for this project are mentioned throughout the project but also listed at the end of the jupyter notebook.
